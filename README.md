# PDF Q&A System

A full-stack application that allows users to upload PDF documents and ask questions about their content using AI.

## Features

- **PDF Upload**: Upload PDF documents for processing
- **AI-Powered Q&A**: Ask questions about the uploaded document content
- **Real-time Processing**: Get instant answers using DistilBERT model
- **Question History**: Keep track of all questions and answers
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices

## Tech Stack

**Backend:**
- Flask (Python web framework)
- PyPDF2 (PDF text extraction)
- LangChain (Document processing and Q&A chains)
- Transformers (Hugging Face models)
- DistilBERT (Question answering model)

**Frontend:**
- React (User interface)
- Axios (HTTP client)
- CSS3 (Styling)

## Setup Instructions

### Backend Setup

1. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd "C:\Users\BADRI NAGARJUN\Desktop\Pdf"
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Python dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Flask server:**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
   The backend will be available at `http://localhost:5000`

### Frontend Setup

1. **Navigate to the frontend directory:**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. **Install Node.js dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the React development server:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

## Usage

1. **Start both servers** (backend on port 5000, frontend on port 3000)
2. **Open your browser** and go to `http://localhost:3000`
3. **Upload a PDF** using the file upload interface
4. **Wait for processing** - the system will extract text and prepare it for Q&A
5. **Ask questions** about the document content in natural language
6. **View answers** generated by the AI model
7. **Browse history** of previous questions and answers

## Notes

- The system uses DistilBERT model for question answering
- PDF text is split into chunks for better processing
- The application runs in development mode with debug enabled
- CORS is enabled to allow frontend-backend communication
- File uploads are stored in the `resources` folder

## Troubleshooting

**Backend Issues:**
- Make sure all Python dependencies are installed
- Check that the virtual environment is activated
- Verify that port 5000 is not in use

**Frontend Issues:**
- Ensure Node.js and npm are installed
- Check that all npm dependencies are installed
- Verify that port 3000 is not in use

**CORS Issues:**
- Make sure Flask-CORS is installed and configured
- Check that both servers are running on the correct ports
